## Kuva Ogris
Any progenitor element is good. Riven is not required at all. Make sure to equip the bane mod since it’s a must have. Non-primed bane is fine too. [Nightwatch Napalm] leaves lingering AOE damage zones, these will kill enemies on spawn as long as you’re firing at the spawn points which makes this the best weapon for Arbitrations.
MAKE SURE YOUR OGRIS ENERGY COLOR IS PURE BLACK, or you’ll blind all your teammates with the visual effect
