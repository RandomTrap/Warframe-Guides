## Kuva Ogris
[Saryn] wants wants either Toxin or Cold progenitor, [Mirage] and [Chroma] heat. Riven is not required at all. Make sure to equip the bane mod since it’s a must have. Non-primed bane is fine too. [Nightwatch Napalm] leaves lingering AOE damage zones, these will kill enemies on spawn as long as you’re firing at the spawn points which makes this the best weapon for Arbitrations.
MAKE SURE YOUR OGRIS ENERGY COLOR IS PURE BLACK, or you’ll blind all your teammates with the visual effect.
You can either run Amalgam Serration for the sprintspeed or Heavy Caliber, but if you run Heavy Caliber it is recommended to run it on Rank 5-6 to reduce the spread.

If you have a riven replace Vigilante Armaments
