# Summary
## Basic Strategy


Things to consider/what you need: 
Summary of how the strat works: 
Get strength boost (with operator and Nidus specter), Buff frames(and yourself), DPS with AOE weapon (Ogris for the most part), Use Dispensary ability or Protea Specter for extra ammo (or Aura). 
Open big map
Kill Arbitration drones for Vitus. 5 drone limit so fast killing important.
Wait for the cat proc (don’t take vitus drops immediately) 
Shoot red dots till they disappear. If you want to make it efficient, choose what side you are holding. Refer to required settings to make the map static so it always will be pointing to north

Specters: 
protea for dispensary (thing that gives you ammo) 
Nidus for extra strength(could be buffed with power donation aura)

Abilities:
Energy Munition for 75% ammo efficiency
Any buff ability (like roar)

Arcanes:
Frames:
Energize - for convenience
Augmentated - for 60% str
Vigor - for more strength

Weps:
Need to investigate

Incarnon:
Thing for the future (who knows) 

Auras:
Primary scavenger
Power donation
Enemy radar
