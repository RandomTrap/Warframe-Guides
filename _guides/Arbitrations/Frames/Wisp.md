*Support Frame, buffs team*

### Strategy
DD with operator if youâ€™re running Madurai or put hardened wellspring if Zenurik
Place your [Nidus Specter][Specters] and wait for it to tether you 
Use an operator ability to trigger Molt Vigor
Get energy orb
Put down your fused reservoir mote where your team will camp, always make sure nidus is tethered before you put them down and that you picked up an energy orb to proc energy conversion before putting motes for maximum power strength
Get energy orb
Cast [Roar]
Throw down [Afentis], then run to enemy spawns and clear them out on smaller maps with sporelancer
When you reach max stacks on molt augmented, make sure to reset your motes so they benefit off the additional 60% power strength

[Nidus Specter][Specters] is key to increasing your Ability Strength to the high levels desired for Arbitrations

[Power Donation] and [Enemy Radar] are interchangeable, coordinate with your team as one person running [Enemy Radar] can really help with shooting at spawns but make sure at least 3 people are running [Power Donation]
